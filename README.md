# BigInteger
integer user defined type in c++ capable of storing values ​​of any size

This project implements the `BigInteger` class, which extends the basic functionality of the `int` type and allows you to store integer numbers of any size. Numbers are interpreted as arrays and digits are stored in reverse order to optimize multiplication and addition operations.

Additionally, the `Rational` class is implemented, which allows you to store any rational numbers. It based on `BigInteger` class, so you'll need both .h files to use it.

All the basic functions are implemented, including conversion operators between built-in classes and user defined.
